# Proof of Concept (POC): GitHub Copilot Agent for Automated Code Review & Quality Assurance

## Overview
This POC demonstrates an automated code review and quality assurance workflow for C# projects using GitHub Actions, a Markdown-based review checklist, and a custom shell script. The solution is designed to ensure code quality, consistency, and compliance with organizational standards, while providing actionable feedback directly on pull requests.

## Key Components

### 1. Review Guidelines (`pr-review-instructions.md`)
- Contains a comprehensive checklist for code review, including:
  - Code quality and naming conventions
  - Error handling
  - Security best practices
  - Test coverage
  - Performance considerations
  - Documentation requirements
  - Code style and formatting
- Serves as the single source of truth for review standards.

### 2. Automated Review Script (`analyze-pr.sh`)
- A Bash script that:
  - Analyzes all changed `.cs` files in a pull request.
  - Checks for violations based on the Markdown checklist (e.g., naming, error handling, documentation, unused variables).
  - Outputs actionable findings to `pr-comment.txt`.
  - Includes the actual class, method, and variable names in comments for clarity.
  - Excludes auto-generated files (e.g., in `obj/` and `bin/`).

### 3. GitHub Actions Workflow (`.github/workflows/pr-review.yml`)
- Runs automatically on every pull request event.
- Steps:
  1. Checks out the code and sets up the .NET environment.
  2. Executes the review script to generate `pr-comment.txt`.
  3. Uploads the comment file as an artifact.
  4. Posts the contents of `pr-comment.txt` as a comment on the PR using the `peter-evans/create-or-update-comment` action.
- No manual intervention or local execution required.

## How It Works
1. **Developer opens or updates a PR.**
2. **GitHub Actions runs the workflow:**
   - The script analyzes the code changes against the standards in `pr-review-instructions.md`.
   - Actionable feedback is posted as a PR comment, e.g.:
     - `[WARNING] Class name not in PascalCase: demo`
     - `[WARNING] No try-catch error handling found.`
     - `[WARNING] Local variable name not in camelCase: Message`
3. **Developers and reviewers see clear, standards-based feedback directly in the PR.**

## Benefits
- **Consistency:** All PRs are reviewed against the same documented standards.
- **Automation:** No need for manual code review for basic quality and style issues.
- **Transparency:** Review comments reference the Markdown checklist, making expectations clear.
- **Extensibility:** Easily add new checks to the script or update the checklist as standards evolve.

## Limitations: Why Not GitHub Copilot Code Review or copilot-agent CLI?

### Why Not GitHub Copilot Code Review?
- As of May 2025, GitHub Copilot Code Review is a preview feature and is not generally available for all organizations or repositories.
- It requires Copilot for Business/Enterprise and must be enabled by your organization.
- Our current environment and licensing do not support enabling this feature, so we use a custom script-based approach instead.
- See: https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/code-review/using-copilot-code-review

### Why Not copilot-agent review-pr CLI?
- The `copilot-agent review-pr` CLI is not publicly available or generally released as of May 2025.
- There is no official installation or usage method for this tool in open-source or standard enterprise environments.
- Our workflow uses a Bash script to simulate automated review logic, but does not rely on unreleased or unsupported Copilot CLI tools.
- As of May 2025, there is no official public documentation or release for the copilot-agent CLI.

## Extending the POC
- Add more advanced static analysis or integrate with tools like Super-Linter or SonarQube.
- Support additional languages or frameworks by updating the script and checklist.
- Use AI-powered review tools for deeper semantic analysis.

## Conclusion
This POC provides a robust, maintainable, and fully automated foundation for code review and quality assurance, leveraging GitHub Actions, Markdown documentation, and custom scripting. It can be adapted and extended to fit a wide range of team and organizational needs.
